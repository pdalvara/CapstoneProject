# Driving Customer Success
This repository includes no data but code used to complete analysis of a business problem. This project was completed using data from a school.  There was over two years worth of monthly data, over 5 million rows of student information, and 52 features for each student.

The purpose of the project was to identify key characteristics of students who were on course to graduate within a set timeframe and those who are not on course.  Additionally, a machine learning model (XGBoost) was used to forecast the next month to determine who would be on/off course.
